					Located in sector 1 of the beautiful city Chandigarh, The Rock Garden has been designed as an open-air exhibition hall using urban and industrial wastes by Nek Chand, a former Road Inspector in Chandigarh. 
					The Rock Garden area is divided into three different phases which have different types of installations and embellishments in them. Phase one is a labyrinth of terracotta pots, chambers and niches that have been decorated with tiles, mirrors, broken bangles, tube light pieces and even toilet fixtures. Statues of various animal, birds and human figures made out of an array of waste matter are installed here.The second phase of the Rock Garden has a huge waterfall and is a major crowd puller in the garden. Amphitheatres, courtyards and intricate pathways are the primary characteristics of this phase, which includes a miniature village as well. Many cultural programmes are held here during various months of the year. Lastly, the third phase is where life size statues of elephants and camels are being installed.
