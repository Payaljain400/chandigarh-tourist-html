        Clean, green and safe, there is no other city in India that is as well planned as Chandigarh.
        <br> <br>
        Nothing compares to the happening crowd in Sec 17, where you can simply wail away time nibbling on ice cream.
        <br> <br>
         It only happens in Chandigarh, girls don’t leave home without their ‘Kineys’ and guys without their ‘Bullts’.
         <br><br>
         “Swag is not something you wear, it is something you are born with” is the mantra that defines Chandigarh.
         <br> <br>
